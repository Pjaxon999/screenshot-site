<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0100.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0100.JPG" alt="Inside the Nexus. An imposing statue with a large ray of light coming from above"></a>
<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0101.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0101.JPG" alt="The first stage of Boletaria. A truly towering castle wall and gate with towers on either side. It is clearly in a state of disrepair. Parts of both towers are on fire"></a> 
<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0102.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0102.JPG" alt="Inside the Nexus. A symbol on the wall clearly inspired by buddhist imagery that resembles a sun surrounded by different decorative patterns. There are some glyphs floating in the foreground"></a>
<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0103.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0103.JPG" alt="The Smithing Grounds. A rocky desert landscape with some wooden cranes and scaffolds in the foreground with what appears to be an old settlement made of stone in the background"></a>
<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0107.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0107.JPG" alt="Stonefang Tunnel. A large underground cave filled with magma. There are some small structures and cranes. There also appear to be some extremely dangerously flimsy bridges between the structures"></a>
<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0109.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0109.JPG" alt="Underground Temple. In the foreground, a large fire colored demonic figure known as Flamelurker. Behind him we see we are in an almost church like room with a large pillar of fire raging above"></a>
<a href="../assets/images/IMG_0111.JPG"><img src="../assets/images/IMG_0111.JPG" alt="Latria. A series of gothic cathedral spires in the foreground. In the background we see a large moon obscured by clouds overlooking several other large gothic cathedral structures"></a>
